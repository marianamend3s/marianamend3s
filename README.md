# 👋 Hi, I'm Mariana

I'm an iOS developer based in Portugal 🇵🇹  
My journey with iOS development started in 2019, as a [TechDojo at Talkdesk](https://engineering.talkdesk.com/tech-dojo-ing-for-ios-2f86225ca93f).  
Right now, I'm a full-time iOS developer at Talkdesk.

## ❤️ About
I'm a proud dog mom of a beautiful being named Ivi, who is the apple of my eye! 🐶 💛  
I love being in nature 🍃, despite being a stay-at-home kind of girl 💁🏻‍♀️  
In my spare time I like to watch movies and tv series, to read, and to play with my beautiful dog 🎉
