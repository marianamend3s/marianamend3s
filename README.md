# 👋 Intro
I'm an iOS developer based in Portugal 🇵🇹  
My journey with iOS development started in 2019, as a [TechDojo at Talkdesk](https://engineering.talkdesk.com/tech-dojo-ing-for-ios-2f86225ca93f) 🥋  
I work full-time on Talkdesk's mobile team ⚡️

## 📝 What I'm up to
⭐ I've been enrolled on this [Udemy's iOS course](https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp/) for ages. I've recently resumed that goal, and I like how I always find something new to learn or to reinforce.  
⭐ I've also created a [blog](https://marianamendes.me), where I'll ***try*** to maintain a writing habit.

## ❤️ About
I'm a proud dog mom of a beautiful being named Ivi, who is the apple of my eye! 🐶 💛  
Although I enjoy being at cozy home, I feel great when I'm surrounded by nature 🍃  
I like watching movies and tv series, reading, listening to music and playing with my beautiful dog 🎉
