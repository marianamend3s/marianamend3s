# 👋 Intro
I'm an iOS developer based in Portugal 🇵🇹  
My journey with iOS development started in 2019, as a [TechDojo](https://careers.talkdesk.com/us/en/student) at [Talkdesk](https://www.talkdesk.com/), and worked there from 2019 to late 2021. Then I was part of an amazing iOS team at Farfetch.
Now I'm an iOS developer at Sky 🚀 and loving it!

## ❤️ About
I'm a proud dog mom of a beautiful being named Ivi, who is the apple of my eye! 🐶 💛  
Although I enjoy being at cozy home, I feel great when I'm surrounded by nature 🍃  
I like watching movies and tv series, traveling, reading, listening to music, riding my bike and playing with my beautiful dog 🎉
